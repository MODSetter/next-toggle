# NEXT-TOGGLE

Next-Toggle is just a simple **plug and use, theme toggle** button with **multiple light and dark themes** for NextJs projects using [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).


# DEMO

## USAGE

Next-Toggle uses next-themes - `useTheme` hook + Background Snippets from : https://github.com/ibelick/background-snippets to apply multiple themes.

You just copy my whole next-toggle component from `@components/next-toggle` 
and use it in your NextJS/ReactJS.

## CONTRIBUTING

 1. Easiest way to contribute is to add more background snippets. Go make some great theme combos.
 2. Add more `ThemeToggler` components using different UI libraries, might help other guys.
 3. If you make any QOL improvement don't be shy to raise PR.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

 - My theme-toggler component `@components/next-toggle/theme-toggler` uses Shadcn components. You can make your component with any UI library of your liking.
